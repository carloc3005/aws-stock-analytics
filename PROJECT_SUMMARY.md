# AWS Stock Market Analytics Pipeline - Project Summary

## Quick Overview
Built a **real-time stock market data analytics pipeline** on AWS using serverless architecture, demonstrating cloud engineering skills and modern data pipeline design.

## What I Built
A production-ready system that:
- Streams live stock data into AWS
- Processes and transforms data automatically
- Stores data efficiently (fast queries + historical analysis)  
- Sends real-time alerts for stock trends
- Enables SQL queries on historical data

## Technologies Used
**AWS Services**: Kinesis, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, Athena, Glue, SNS, IAM  
**Languages**: Python 3.14  
**Libraries**: boto3 (AWS SDK), yfinance (stock data API)

## Key Achievements
✅ Designed and implemented event-driven serverless architecture  
✅ Processed real-time data streams with <1 second latency  
✅ Implemented multi-tier storage strategy (NoSQL + Object Storage)  
✅ Built automated alerting system for stock trends  
✅ Created cost-optimized solution ($1-2 total cost)  
✅ Integrated 7 different AWS services seamlessly  

## Technical Highlights
- **Scalable**: Handles thousands of records per hour
- **Serverless**: Zero server management required
- **Cost-effective**: Pay only for what you use
- **Real-time**: 30-second data refresh intervals
- **Queryable**: SQL analytics on historical data via Athena

## Skills Demonstrated
**Cloud Engineering**: AWS architecture design, service integration, IAM security  
**Data Engineering**: Stream processing, ETL pipelines, data modeling  
**Software Development**: Python, AWS SDK, error handling, logging  
**DevOps**: Cloud resource provisioning, monitoring, cost optimization

## Project Metrics
- **Duration**: 4.5 hours (design to deployment)
- **Cost**: ~$1.50 for full implementation and testing
- **Services Integrated**: 7 AWS services
- **Code**: ~200 lines of Python
- **Architecture**: Event-driven, serverless

## Business Value
This architecture pattern is used in production for:
- Financial data analysis
- IoT sensor monitoring
- Real-time analytics dashboards
- Automated trading systems
- Risk management systems

## What I Learned
1. Event-driven architecture design patterns
2. AWS service selection and integration
3. Real-time stream processing techniques
4. Cost optimization strategies in cloud
5. Security best practices (IAM, encryption)
6. Troubleshooting distributed systems
7. Cloud resource naming and region management
