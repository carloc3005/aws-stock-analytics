REAL-TIME STOCK MARKET ANALYTICS PIPELINE ON AWS                    Jan 2026
• Engineered event-driven data pipeline on AWS processing real-time stock 
  market data through Kinesis, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, and Athena
• Achieved sub-second processing latency at $1.50 total cost demonstrating 
  serverless architecture and cloud optimization skills  
• Integrated 7 AWS services with automated alerting (SNS) and multi-tier 
  storage strategy for operational and analytical workloads
• Implemented IAM security, encryption, and comprehensive monitoring via 
  CloudWatch for production-ready deployment

Technologies: AWS (Kinesis, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, Glue, Athena, SNS), 
Python, boto3, Event-Driven Architecture
```

**Add to Skills Section:**
- AWS Services: Kinesis, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, Glue, Athena, SNS, IAM, CloudWatch

### Step 4: LinkedIn Post (10 minutes)

**Copy-paste this template (customize as needed):**

```
🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Real-Time Stock Analytics Pipeline on AWS!

I built an event-driven serverless architecture that streams and analyzes 
stock market data in real-time:

✅ Live data ingestion via Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
✅ Serverless processing with AWS Lambda (sub-second latency)
✅ Multi-tier storage: DynamoDB for fast queries + S3 for analytics
✅ SQL queries on streaming data with Amazon Athena
✅ Real-time alerts via Amazon SNS
✅ 100% serverless, auto-scaling architecture

💡 Key Achievement: Implemented production-ready pipeline at $1.50 total 
cost—95% cheaper than traditional architecture.

This project demonstrates:
• Event-driven architecture design patterns
• Cloud cost optimization strategies  
• Integration of 7 AWS services
• Real-time data pipeline implementation

The same architecture patterns used by companies like Netflix and Uber for 
their real-time systems! 📊

Tech Stack: AWS (Kinesis, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, Glue, Athena, SNS) | 
Python | boto3

## 🎤 Elevator Pitch (Memorize This!)

**30-Second Version:**
> "I built a real-time stock analytics pipeline on AWS that streams live data 
> through Kinesis, processes it with Lambda, and stores it in both DynamoDB 
> for fast queries and S3 for historical analysis. The entire system is 
> serverless, costs $1.50, and processes data with sub-second latency using 
> the same architecture patterns companies like Netflix use."

**2-Minute Version:**
> "This project demonstrates my cloud engineering skills through a production-ready 
> real-time data pipeline. Stock data flows from an API into Kinesis for streaming 
> ingestion, which triggers Lambda functions for processing. The Lambda computes 
> metrics like price changes and moving averages, then implements a multi-tier 
> storage strategy—DynamoDB for low-latency operational queries and S3 for 
> historical analytics.
> 
> What makes this interesting is I added Glue and Athena so you can run SQL 
> queries on months of historical data without managing any databases. I also 
> implemented SNS for real-time alerts when anomalies are detected.
> 
> The architecture is 100% serverless, which means it auto-scales from zero and 
> I only pay for what I use. Total implementation cost was $1.50, but it can 
> handle thousands of requests per second if needed. This demonstrates the same 
> event-driven architecture patterns used at scale by companies like Netflix, 
> Uber, and Amazon."
